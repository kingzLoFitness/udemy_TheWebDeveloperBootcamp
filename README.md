this is my version of the Todo App.  See inside the .js file and when going through the html or the link I'll create through github, be sure to open up the console to see my version the output.  Any questions feel free to ask.

I have both todo.js and todo2.js.  The todo2.js is the more recent version that links to the HTML file.
