<h1>Todo List</h1>
<ul>
<li>"new" - Add A Todo</li>
<li>"list" - View All todos</li>
<li>"delete" - Remove specific Todo by value
<li>"deleteIndex" - Remove specific Todo by index
<li>"quit" - Quit App</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: This is my version before going over the code with Colt Steele's course.  I have his original code and compare the my own to his afterwards.  This was done in Part 1 and about to get done with Part 2 of this Todo List App.</p>

<p>Additional NOTE: start off with quit to / open up the console / refresh browser to run the JavaScript again, in order to get the output within the console.</p>
